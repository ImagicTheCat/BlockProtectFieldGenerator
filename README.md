## Usage

* mine the block with a Pickaxe.
* right-click to register youself to the generator
* sneak + right-click to show all registered players

## Characteristics

* each field generator protect a cube of radius 8 from the itself (so 8+1+8 blocks on a specific axis)
* if only one not allowed field generator is present, you will no be able to build, break or interact directly with blocks (but dropped items, xp, pressure plates, etc will still work)
